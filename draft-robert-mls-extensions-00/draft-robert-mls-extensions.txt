1.  Introduction

   This document describes extensions to the Messaging Layer Security
   (MLS) protocol that are not part of the main protocol specification.
   The protocol specification includes a set of core extensions that are
   likely to be useful to many applications.  The extensions described
   in this document are intended to be used by applications that need to
   extend the MLS protocol.

2.  Extensions

2.1.  AppAck

   Type: Proposal

2.1.1.  Description

   An AppAck proposal is used to acknowledge receipt of application
   messages.  Though this information implies no change to the group, it
   is structured as a Proposal message so that it is included in the
   group's transcript by being included in Commit messages.

   struct {
       uint32 sender;
       uint32 first_generation;
       uint32 last_generation;
   } MessageRange;

   struct {
       MessageRange received_ranges<V>;
   } AppAck;

   An AppAck proposal represents a set of messages received by the
   sender in the current epoch.  Messages are represented by the sender
   and generation values in the MLSCiphertext for the message.  Each
   MessageRange represents receipt of a span of messages whose
   generation values form a continuous range from first_generation to
   last_generation, inclusive.

   AppAck proposals are sent as a guard against the Delivery Service
   dropping application messages.  The sequential nature of the
   generation field provides a degree of loss detection, since gaps in
   the generation sequence indicate dropped messages.  AppAck completes
   this story by addressing the scenario where the Delivery Service
   drops all messages after a certain point, so that a later generation
   is never observed.  Obviously, there is a risk that AppAck messages
   could be suppressed as well, but their inclusion in the transcript
   means that if they are suppressed then the group cannot advance at
   all.

   The schedule on which sending AppAck proposals are sent is up to the
   application, and determines which cases of loss/suppression are
   detected.  For example:

   *  The application might have the committer include an AppAck
      proposal whenever a Commit is sent, so that other members could
      know when one of their messages did not reach the committer.

   *  The application could have a client send an AppAck whenever an
      application message is sent, covering all messages received since
      its last AppAck.  This would provide a complete view of any losses
      experienced by active members.

   *  The application could simply have clients send AppAck proposals on
      a timer, so that all participants' state would be known.

   An application using AppAck proposals to guard against loss/
   suppression of application messages also needs to ensure that AppAck
   messages and the Commits that reference them are not dropped.  One
   way to do this is to always encrypt Proposal and Commit messages, to
   make it more difficult for the Delivery Service to recognize which
   messages contain AppAcks.  The application can also have clients
   enforce an AppAck schedule, reporting loss if an AppAck is not
   received at the expected time.

3.  IANA Considerations

   This document requests the creation of the following new IANA
   registries:

   *  MLS Extension Types (Section 3.1)

   *  MLS Proposal Types (Section 3.2)

   All of these registries should be under a heading of "Messaging Layer
   Security", and assignments are made via the Specification Required
   policy [RFC8126].

   RFC EDITOR: Please replace XXXX throughout with the RFC number
   assigned to this document

3.1.  Extended MLS Extension types

   This registry lists identifiers for extensions to the MLS protocol.
   The extension type field is two bytes wide, so valid extension type
   values are in the range 0x0000 to 0xffff.

   Template:

   *  Value: The numeric value of the extension type.  Extended MLS
      extension types start with the value 0x0100.

   *  Name: The name of the extension type

   *  Message(s): The messages in which the extension may appear, drawn
      from the following list:

      -  KP: KeyPackage objects

      -  LN: LeafNode objects

      -  GC: GroupContext objects (and the group_context_extensions
         field of GroupInfo objects)

      -  GI: The other_extensions field of GroupInfo objects

   *  Recommended: Whether support for this extension is recommended by
      the IETF MLS WG.  Valid values are "Y" and "N".  The "Recommended"
      column is assigned a value of "N" unless explicitly requested, and
      adding a value with a "Recommended" value of "Y" requires
      Standards Action [RFC8126].  IESG Approval is REQUIRED for a Y->N
      transition.

   *  Reference: The document where this extension is defined

   Initial contents:

          +=======+======+============+=============+===========+
          | Value | Name | Message(s) | Recommended | Reference |
          +=======+======+============+=============+===========+
          | N/A   | N/A  | N/A        | N/A         | RFC XXXX  |
          +-------+------+------------+-------------+-----------+

3.2.  Extended MLS Proposal types

   This registry lists identifiers for types of proposals that can be
   made for changes to an MLS group.  The extension type field is two
   bytes wide, so valid extension type values are in the range 0x0000 to
   0xffff.

   Template:

   *  Value: The numeric value of the proposal type.  Extended MLS
      proposal types start with the value 0x0100.

   *  Name: The name of the proposal type

   *  Recommended: Whether support for this extension is recommended by
      the IETF MLS WG.  Valid values are "Y" and "N".  The "Recommended"
      column is assigned a value of "N" unless explicitly requested, and
      adding a value with a "Recommended" value of "Y" requires
      Standards Action [RFC8126].  IESG Approval is REQUIRED for a Y->N
      transition.

   *  Path Required: Whether a Commit covering a proposal of this type
      is required to have its path field populated.

   *  Reference: The document where this extension is defined

   Initial contents:

      +========+=========+=============+===============+===========+
      | Value  | Name    | Recommended | Path Required | Reference |
      +========+=========+=============+===============+===========+
      | 0x0100 | app_ack | Y           | Y             | RFC XXXX  |
      +--------+---------+-------------+---------------+-----------+
